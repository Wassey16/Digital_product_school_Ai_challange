# Digital Product School AI Challenge

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic data, visualizing it, and building predictive models to forecast future trends. The primary steps include data visualization, model training, and deployment of the best-performing model.

## Project Structure

- **ai_chalange.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire workflow, including:
  - Data visualization and understanding
  - Training multiple machine learning models
  - Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

- **xg_model.pkl**: The best-performing model, an XGBoost regressor, saved for deployment.

- **app.py**: A Flask web application that serves as an endpoint for:
  - **POST method**: For predicting future values based on the input data
  - **Web interface**: For user interaction

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.

- **templates/home.html**: The HTML template for the web interface of the Flask app.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. Flask
3. XGBoost
